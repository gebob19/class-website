Hello everyone,

Your midterm exam marks are now available on Blackboard. The class average is 82%!

First of all, I must congratulate the class as a whole! You guys have done an amazing job and I am super proud of you. I know for most of you, CS is new and you should be proud that you have put up a commendable effort. The key now is to sustain this until the end of the term. And I am sure you can do this, if you maintain the same level of hard work and dedication! 

We look at tomorrow introduction to HTML and CSS. We are hoping to have your Assignment1 out by end of the week. 

thanks,

abbas
