title: Solution to InClass WorkSheet1 posted and Office Hours schedule.

Hello everyone,

* I have posted the solutions to InClass Worksheet1. You may want to revisit at
least up to (f) before next lecture. This will serve as a good review before we
take up more challenging queries using relational algebra.

  * Also, in the next week tutorial, i.e., in the week starting 22nd January we
  will use some portion of the tutorial towards 'tutorial quiz.' The 'tutorial
  quiz' is separate and distinct from the 'actual quizzes' that will be
  conducted in lecture. Please see your course syllabus for the schedule of
  the 'actual quizzes.' 

* The purpose and point of the 'tutorial quizzes' are two-fold: 

  * Prepare you for the 'actual quizzes'

  * The marks that you gain on the 'tutorial quizzes' will count towards the lab component. 

I do not plan to have 'tutorial quizzes' in every tutorial, but these will frequently be scheduled in the tutorial during the term. 

My office hours are: Mondays and Fridays from 11:30am to 1:15pm in IC 478.
