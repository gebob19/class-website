Hello everone,

* I have posted a sample midterm exam with solutions for you to practice. This midterm exam was prepared by some instructor in 2009, however you may want to look at it if you want some more practice. There may be few things in this exam that we have't looked at such as `having', `group by' in SQL queries. However, on your actual midterm exam, I will make sure that if something is new, these will be well defined in the appendix. 

* Also, the solution for quiz1 are now posted. 


thanks,

abbas
