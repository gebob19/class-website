title: Avoid putting SQL queries (including insertion) on Blackboard

Hello everyone,

Friendly reminder to not put any sql queries (including select and insertion statements). I agree 100% that it may seem silly to not put insertion statements, but this restriction on insertion statements is only for A1. I want everyone to go through this manually atleast for one assignment. 

Happy SQL learning! 

thanks,

abbas
