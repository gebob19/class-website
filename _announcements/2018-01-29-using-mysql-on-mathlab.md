title: Using MySQL on mathlab @ UTSC
author: Abbas Attarwala

Hello everyone,

I want to make the process of using MySQL easy. Each one of you now has MySQL running on the mathlab machine. This is what you are required to do:

1. You are still required to download/install some kind of front end on your computer. I am using SEQUELPRO for this. 

2. On SEQUELPRO, under the following fields enter:

Host: mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca

UserName: << utorid>>

Password: << utorid>>

First, make sure that you can complete step 2). If step 2 succeeds, I want you to first immediately change your password from < utorid>> to something else. Just enter your utorid without the angle brackets. 

After completion of Step 2), you should now have a window very similar to what we did in the lecture this morning. This will allow you to create a database and a table etc. 
I will also post this announcement on Piazza with images.
