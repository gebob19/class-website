Hello everyone,

I am sorry that I have made a typo in the email. The weighted average of Question 2 should be out of 40. 

Weighted total of Q1 is calculated by YourMark/45*40 and Q2 by YourMark/52*40.

Total is out of 100 (40+40+20), and it is possible to exceed 100 due to bouns.

All emails have been sent. Please let me know if you don't receive one.

Thank you,
Bryan
