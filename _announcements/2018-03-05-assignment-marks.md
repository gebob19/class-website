Hello everyone,

Your assignment 1 marks are now available on Blackboard. The class average is 86%!

You will soon receive a separate email about the breakdown of your mark. The rubric is given below:

Question 1:
Each sub-question is worth 5 points. The total is then converted to a full mark of 40.
5 points: Solution is correct and well written. There does not seem to be any glaring omission or missing components. Output table generated seems to be correct and consistent with the data that was provided in the assignment handout. 
4 points: Solution seems to be correct. However, there seem to be few things missing and does not completely address the question.  Output table generated seems to be partially correct with the data that was provided in the assignment handout. 
3 points: This may also include missing output table or incorrect rows in the output table. 
1 points: Solution is incorrect. Your solution does not have any resemblance with what the question is asking for. 
0 points: Missing or no solution. 

Question 2:
Each sub-question is worth 4 points. The total is then converted to a full mark of 40.
4 points: Solution is correct and well written. There does not seem to be any glaring omission or missing components. Output table generated seems to be correct and consistent with the data that was provided in the assignment handout. 
3 points: Solution seems to be correct. However, there seem to be few things missing and does not completely address the question.  Output table generated seems to be partially correct with the data that was provided in the assignment handout. 
1 points: This may also include missing output table or incorrect rows in the output table. 
0 points: Solution is incorrect. Your solution does not have any resemblance with what the question is asking for. 

Question 3:
20 points: Completely correct answer.
10 points: Partially correct answer (there are some mistakes, i.e. the SQL queries are not created correct i.e. missing certain key words).
0 points: Incorrect answer.

Question 1 Bonus:
5 points: Correct answers for all sub-questions
0 points: Some incorrect answers or didn't attempt
