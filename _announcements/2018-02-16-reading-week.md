Hello everyone,

Have a wonderful reading break! Take some time off and I want you to relax few days. However, just do not forget the word 'reading' in reading break! In that spirit, here are some great resources for you to read over the break on web programming. This is going to be the major  topic in the 2nd half:

1. https://www.w3schools.com/html/

2. https://www.w3schools.com/css/

3. https://www.w3schools.com/js/

The above three links should atleast give you some overview on what html, css and javascript are.  

* We will get your A1 and Midterm Exam marks in the week after reading break. More information on this later in next class. Your A2 should be out sometime over the break.
