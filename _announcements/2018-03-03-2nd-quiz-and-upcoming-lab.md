Hello everyone,

I will move the 2nd Quiz from 5th March over to 12th March. I am doing this because we have so far just had one lecture on HTML and CSS. I do not think it is fair if I ask you to write a quiz just after one lecture. I want you guys to do well on the quiz, and by having two lectures under our belt, you will be better prepared for the quiz. 

Also the lab that is coming up, we will explore floats and CSS in greater detail. This will also allow you to get better and apply it on your assignment.
