Hello everyone,

I want each one of you to read this email carefully, regarding your seating arrangement on 12th  February.

* The exam begins promptly at 9:10am.  The  exam ends at 11am .

* Based on your last names (NOT MIDDLE NAME, NOT FIRST NAME)  here are the seating arrangements:

Last Name (A-N) in SW 319

Last Name (P-T) in  MW  120

Last Name (U-Z) in  PO 101

* Please make sure you come to the correct room as we will take attendance based on your last names. Your exam will not be marked if you are sitting in the wrong room. 

* You are also asked to bring in your STUDENT ID or some other Government issued card that has your picture on it. 

* As said in lecture, the exam is closed book and no aid of any kind is allowed. 

* You cannot leave the exam hall in the first 10 minutes or the last 10 minutes of the exam. Once all the exams have been collected by the invigilators and counted, they will then signal you to leave. 

thanks,

abbas
