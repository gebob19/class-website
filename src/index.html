            Reiterating some important concepts about Assignment2
          </h2>

        <div class="announcement--content">
          <p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>As you plow on assignment2, here are some things to keep in mind as also discussed earlier in lecture:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>You cannot use 3rd party CSS framework.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You cannot use 3rd party JavaScript framework such as JQuery etc.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ul>
            <li>However, you can use your own JavaScript functions written by you and which does not reference any 3rd party
              JavaScript frameworks.</li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The due date for assignment2 is 12th March @ 11:59 pm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You can use the content (such as pdf, instructor name, TA name, etc. etc.) from either Anna’s website or our
                current website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Each user story can be 2-3 sentences. Concentrate on how the user will interact with your website. Also to
                think about here is the kinds of user (instructor or admin or student). Your user stories and mock diagram
                must be well considered and thorough. In your mock diagram, please do not use a screenshot of the actual
                web page. This is incorrect. The mock diagram happens first. At this point, you have a rough idea of how
                the webpage should work and how the user will interact with it.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ul>
            <li>At no point in the mocks should we see elements that reflect the actual webpage. Again use the wireframe mockup
              (referenced in the handout) to draw these out.</li>
            <li>However, when you implement (when you start using HTML and CSS) these user stories on your web page, it is OK
              if you just concentrate from the student point of view.</li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Here are some example of user stories, that I encourage you to read and get familiar with: https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure to test and run your webpage on Google Chrome. If your webpage depends on some images and other resources,
                make sure to have them placed appropriately in the directory that you submit to us. Please see the assignment
                handout for this.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I hope you can take advantage of all the office hours this week towards your assignment2 and for prep towards
                quiz2.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>thanks, abbas

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>I will move the 2nd Quiz from 5th March over to 12th March. I am doing this because we have so far just had one
            lecture on HTML and CSS. I do not think it is fair if I ask you to write a quiz just after one lecture. I want
            you guys to do well on the quiz, and by having two lectures under our belt, you will be better prepared for the
            quiz.</p>

          <p>Also the lab that is coming up, we will explore floats and CSS in greater detail. This will also allow you to get
            better and apply it on your assignment.</p>

          <p>First of all, I must congratulate the class as a whole! You guys have done an amazing job and I am super proud
            of you. I know for most of you, CS is new and you should be proud that you have put up a commendable effort.
            The key now is to sustain this until the end of the term. And I am sure you can do this, if you maintain the
            same level of hard work and dedication!</p>

          <p>We look at tomorrow introduction to HTML and CSS. We are hoping to have your Assignment1 out by end of the week.</p>

                in this exam that we have’t looked at such as
                <code class="highlighter-rouge">having', </code>group by’ in SQL queries. However, on your actual midterm exam, I will make sure that if something is new,
                these will be well defined in the appendix.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>I want to make the process of using MySQL easy. Each one of you now has MySQL running on the mathlab machine. This
            is what you are required to do:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>You are still required to download/install some kind of front end on your computer. I am using SEQUELPRO for
                this.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>On SEQUELPRO, under the following fields enter:</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Host: mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca</p>

          <p>UserName: « utorid»</p>

          <p>Password: « utorid»</p>

          <p>First, make sure that you can complete step 2). If step 2 succeeds, I want you to first immediately change your
            password from &lt; utorid» to something else. Just enter your utorid without the angle brackets.</p>

          <p>After completion of Step 2), you should now have a window very similar to what we did in the lecture this morning.
            This will allow you to create a database and a table etc. I will also post this announcement on Piazza with images.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone,I have received some questions about quiz1, and I think it is best that I send this out to everyone.</p>

          <p>Question) Is the quiz hard?</p>

          <p>Answer) Absolutely! That being said, I think it will be a fair quiz, i.e., if you have worked through the problems
            we did in lecture and tutorial.</p>

          <p>Question) What will the quiz be on?</p>

          <p>Answer) Relational Algebra</p>

          <p>Question) How long is the quiz?</p>

          <p>Answer) You can expect around 10-15 minutes.</p>

          <p>Question) Is it closed book?</p>

          <p>Answer) Yes.</p>

          <p>Question) Should I be familiar with all the different operators in Relational algebra such as join(s), selection,
            projection, etc. etc. that we studied in lecture</p>

          <p>Answer) Yes!</p>

            Solution to InClass WorkSheet1 posted and Office Hours schedule.

        <div class="announcement--content">
          <p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>I have posted the solutions to InClass Worksheet1. You may want to revisit at least up to (f) before next lecture.
                This will serve as a good review before we take up more challenging queries using relational algebra.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Also, in the next week tutorial, i.e., in the week starting 22nd January we will use some portion of the
                  tutorial towards ‘tutorial quiz.’ The ‘tutorial quiz’ is separate and distinct from the ‘actual quizzes’
                  that will be conducted in lecture. Please see your course syllabus for the schedule of the ‘actual quizzes.’</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The purpose and point of the ‘tutorial quizzes’ are two-fold:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Prepare you for the ‘actual quizzes’</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The marks that you gain on the ‘tutorial quizzes’ will count towards the lab component.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I do not plan to have ‘tutorial quizzes’ in every tutorial, but these will frequently be scheduled in the tutorial
            during the term.</p>

          <p>My office hours are: Mondays and Fridays from 11:30am to 1:15pm in IC 478.</p>
